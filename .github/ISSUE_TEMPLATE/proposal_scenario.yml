name: " Proposal : ðŸ§ª Scenario Proposal"
about: Propose a new benchmark scenario (Synthetic, OpenDSS, or Real/CSV)
title: "[Scenario] <short name>"
labels: scenario, enhancement
assignees: ""

### Scenario Type
- [ ] Synthetic (Python)
- [ ] OpenDSS (IEEE feeder)
- [ ] Real/CSV (measured)

### Scenario ID (folder name)
`sX_<short-id>`

### Overview
What does this scenario test and why?

### Signal / Simulation Spec
- fs, duration, channels
- noise, harmonics
- events (steps/ramps/faults/taps), timing

### OpenDSS Details (if applicable)
Feeder, DSS files, faults/taps, export points, resampling strategy.

### Ground Truth Definition
Analytic truth / DSS source profile / reference PMU; include uncertainty.

### Outputs
- data/raw/<scenario>/â€¦
- data/truth/<scenario>/â€¦
- plots/

### Metrics & Compliance
Which metrics/envelopes, thresholds, and performance requirements.

### Dependencies & References
Packages, datasets, papers, licenses.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Code under `scenarios/<id>/`
- [ ] Deterministic seed & reproducible outputs
- [ ] Truth generated & validated
- [ ] At least one estimator runs end-to-end
- [ ] Docs snippet added
- [ ] CI smoke test

### Complexity (estimate)
S / M / L

### Notes
Any risks, limitations, or follow-ups.
